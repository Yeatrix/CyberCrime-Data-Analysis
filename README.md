# Cybercrime Data Analysis Project

With the rise of AI and Machine Learning, the concern for data and software security is more critical than ever. To build effective defenses, it's essential to analyze historical cyber threats to inform policy decisions and prioritize security interventions.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow on a simulated dataset of global cybercrimes. The primary objective is to showcase the methodology of data exploration, KPI computation, visualization, and predictive modeling in a controlled environment.

### Dataset
This analysis uses the Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015-2024), sourced from Kaggle.

It is important to note that this is a synthetic dataset generated for educational and analytical purposes. While its structure is inspired by real-world sources like the Verizon DBIR and MITRE ATT&CK Framework, it is not based on actual incident data. This makes it an ideal sandbox for testing and demonstrating analytical techniques.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used in the analysis.
  - **README.md**: Documentation about the data sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis.
  - **analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for documenting the analysis process with code and markdown cells.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using the command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` directory to start the analysis.

## Usage

- The complete code and implementation for this projects 'obj1' can be found in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
