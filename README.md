# Cybercrime Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze cybercrime data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help in understanding the nature of cybercrime incidents. The analysis will involve data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of the results.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used in the analysis.
  - **README.md**: Documentation about the data sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis.
  - **analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for documenting the analysis process with code and markdown cells.
  
- **src/**: Contains source code for data processing and analysis.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing the cybercrime data.
  - **analysis.py**: Functions for performing statistical analysis on the preprocessed data.
  - **visualization.py**: Functions for creating visual representations of the analysis results.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using the command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` directory to start the analysis.

## Usage

- Use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to load and preprocess the data.
- Run the `analysis.py` script to perform statistical analysis.
- Utilize the `visualization.py` script to create visualizations of the results.
- Document your findings in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
